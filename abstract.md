# Using R, RStudio, and Docker for introductory statistics teaching

## Revised title: R, RStudio, and Docker playing nice in the classroom

Docker is a relatively new Linux container technology that can be used as a 
lightweight form of virtualization. At Duke University we have been using 
Docker containers to provide students with anywhere access to RStudio Server 
via the campus-wide authentication system. This solution eliminates the need 
for students to locally install R and RStudio, and hence makes getting started 
with R considerably easier for students who are brand new to statistics and 
computing. This solution also provides secure self-contained virtualized 
environments for each student with specified quotas for system resources. 
Additionally, it simplifies the maintenance and support while allowing for 
deployment across multiple heterogeneous physical systems. In this talk we 
will discuss implementation and benefits of using Docker and RStudio Server as 
an environment for teaching R at the introductory level.
